   <h4>Project Tab</h4>
   <p>Here are listed some of the projects I have completed as functional Web Apps or just a Demo. The projects you will find will include the repository so you can visit it. In case there is no link there it mean that it's a live project for a client so i will not be able to provide it, but you can come in contact with me from the contact form and ask me if you have any question.</p>
